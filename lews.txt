*Where are all the dead? Why will they not be silent?*
*Distant Weeping*
***NO! I AM MYSELF! I AM LEWS THERIN TELAMON! I AM MEEEEEeeeee!***
*Humming*
Never prod at a woman unless you must. She will kill you faster than a man and for less reason, even if she weeps over it after.
***I am not dead!*** *I deserve death, but I am* ***ALIVE! ALIVE! ALIVE!***
*Are you real? Am I?*
*I killed the whole world, and you can too, if you try hard.*
*The dead watch. The dead never close their eyes.*
*I would not mind you in my head, if you were not so clearly mad.*
*Madness waits for some. It creeps up on others.*
*Do you have the Horn of Valere hidden in your pocket this time?*
*Your plans fail because you want to live, madman.*
*Dead men should be quiet in their graves, but they never are.*
*A man who trusts everyone is a fool, and a man who trusts no one is a fool. We are all fools if we live long enough.*
***Oh, Light, why do I have a madman in my head? Why? Why?***
***I told you to kill them all when you had the chance. I told you.***
***Oh, Light. That’s impossible! We can’t use it! Cast it away! That is death we hold, death and betrayal. It is HIM.***
*Trust is death*
***Break it break them all must break them must must must break them all break them and strike must strike quickly must strike now break it break it break it...*
*The Wheel of Time and the wheel of a man's life turn alike without pity or mercy.*
*I thought I could build. I was wrong. We are not builders, not you, or I, or the other one. We are destroyers. Destroyers.*
*What makes you think you can keep anyone safe? We are all going to die. Just hope that you aren't the one who kills them.*
*Why do we live again?*
*We all have our limits. And we set them further out than we have any right.*
*Take what you can have. Rejoice in what you can save, and do not mourn your losses too long.*
*The only way to live is to die. I must die. I deserve only death.*
*Pride fills me. I am sick with the pride that destroyed me.*
*A man without trust might as well be dead.*
*You never escape the traps you spin yourself. Only a greater power can break a power, and then you're trapped again. Trapped forever so you cannot die.
*What you want is what you cannot have. What you cannot have is what you want.*
*If it hurts too much, make it hurt someone else instead.*
*Nothing ever goes as you expect. Expect nothing, and you will not be surprised. Expect nothing. Hope for nothing. Nothing.*
***Break the seals. Break the seals, and end it. Let me die forever.*
*Sometimes, pain is all that lets you know you're alive.*
***ILYENA, MY LOVE, FORGIVE ME!***
