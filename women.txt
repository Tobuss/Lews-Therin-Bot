*Never prod at a woman unless you must. She will kill you faster than a man and for less reason, even if she weeps over it after.*
*Most women will shrug off what a man would kill you for, and kill you for what a man would shrug off.*

*Mustn't use that. Threatens the fabric of the pattern. Not even for Ilyena? I would burn the world and use my soul for tinder to hear her laugh again.*
***ILYENAAAAAA!!***
